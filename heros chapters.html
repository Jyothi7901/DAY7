Early life
Dhanush was born as Venkatesh Prabhu Kasthuri Raja[17] on 28 July 1983 to Tamil film director and producer, Kasthuri Raja, and his wife, Vijayalakshmi, in Madras, Tamil Nadu.[18] Initially he wished to study Hotel Management and become a chef.[19] However his elder brother, film director Selvaraghavan, pressured him to become an actor.[20][21] Dhanush also has two sisters named Vimalageetha and Karthiga Karthik.[22]

Acting career
2002–2010: Career beginnings
Venkatesh Prabhu adopted the screen name "Dhanush" after being inspired by the fictional covert operation from Kuruthipunal (1995).He debuted in the 2002 teen drama film Thulluvadho Ilamai, directed by his father Kasthuri Raja, which became a sleeper hit. He then appeared in his brother Selvaraghavan's first directorial venture, the romantic psychological thriller Kaadhal Kondein in 2003. The film portrayed Dhanush as a mentally-disturbed youth, Vinodh, who yearned for the love of his friend, eventually turning possessive of her. Upon release, the film opened to critical acclaim and proved to be a major commercial success, eventually becoming Dhanush's breakthrough in Tamil cinema.[24] The film also fetched him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. His next film was the romantic comedy Thiruda Thirudi (2003), a critical and commercial success.[25]

In 2004, Dhanush appeared in Pudhukottaiyilirundhu Saravanan and Sulaan. Later, he also appeared in Dreams, another film panned by critics.The film was directed by his father, like their previous ventures. In 2005, Dhanush appeared in Devathaiyai Kanden and in the same year, he also worked on Balu Mahendra's Adhu Oru Kana Kaalam. Though it was a commercial disaster at the box office, Dhanush has repeatedly stated that he started taking acting seriously only after working with Mahendra.

In 2006, he reunited with his brother for the cult gangster film, Pudhupettai. It portrayed a young man's journey from a street urchin to gangster, receiving mixed reviews, initially, though Dhanush's performance received major praise. However, over the years, the film has undergone a critical re-evaluation and is now considered to be one of the greatest Tamil films ever made, whilst also garnering a huge cult following. Dhanush subsequently received his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil, for his performance in the film. That same year, he also reunited with Boopathy Pandian after Devathaiyai Kanden, for the romantic comedy, Thiruvilaiyaadal Aarambam, opposite Shriya Saran and Prakash Raj. It was a major commercial success, a first for Dhanush, after several average and below-average grossers.

Dhanush's first release of 2007, Parattai Engira Azhagu Sundaram did not do well at the box office. The film was a remake of the successful Kannada language film Jogi (2005). However, his second film Polladhavan was released during Diwali 2007. Polladhavan was based on the 1948–Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves and Dhanush's performance was appreciated.

The following year, the remake of a Telugu film directed by his brother formed the plot line for Dhanush's next film directed by debutant Mithran Jawahar, later titled Yaaradi Nee Mohini. The romantic comedy proved to be a major critical and commercial success, thus earning Dhanush his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He later appeared in a cameo appearance, for his father-in-law Rajinikanth's venture Kuselan. His subsequent venture was Suraj's Padikathavan, which was released in January 2009. His performance was praised and well received. His next two films Kutty and Uthama Puthiran, were both collaborations with director Mithran Jawahar.

The song "Un Mele Aasaidhaan" from the action-adventure film Aayirathil Oruvan, which featured him alongside his then wife Aishwarya Rajinikanth, won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer – Tamil.
